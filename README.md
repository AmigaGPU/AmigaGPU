- 👋 @AmigaGPU here,
- 👀 I’m interested a lot in programming i can use in network based semi-automated maintanance of server (groups)
- 🌱 Currently learning some GoLang and C
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on any project ATM, I'm documenting my #Linux path since the pre-alpha days with Linus working from comp.os.* news groups
- to get alpha testers to play with the kernel, no userland progs then and you had to crosscompile eveything, details are in my main doc project
- 📫 How to reach me simple, I have @RadioAuzreus on twitter, Telegram and Signal handles. Simplest is twitter, I also have the github mobile app so sending me a msg here will light that notification up also
